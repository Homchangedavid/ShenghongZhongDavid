# 1. What - A building blocks of the Web
* What's HTML?

Hyper Text Markup Language - as you can see in the name, it's **NOT** a programming language. because it doesn't have any functionality. 
To take a metaphor, it's approximatealy LEGO brick
Inline-style: 
![alt text](https://github.com/Homchangedavid/homchangedavid.github.io/blob/master/images/LEGO_brick.png "Foundation")

Therefore, it's definitely ugly.

# 2. Why?

I'm afraid that there is no really direct answer to why it's called Html. Historically, it's created by a geneuis who wants to see 
what other enginners are doing but it's so difficult so this guy designs this markup language for this use.

# 3. How

##Step 1 : Creating an HTML File

Notice that it hasn't needed a server yet.

Files must end with the "xxxx.html" such as this extension.

And then it's need to runs in a web browser ( Chorme, FireFox, etc)

####Why is the first file called index.html?

Good question. In the early ages, it aims to navigate computer for a specific directory that would list directly the files in it.
Simply, it's like you click on a folder in your computer. The early web servers generate an actual index ( a list of links to the files
in the current folder), if you preferred your own custom index of the files. That's why the default html file is called "index.html." 
Replacing "Index.html." so let's call "Index.html." 

**To sum up, index.html is the root/home page of a website**

* S1-01
What's happening here? You can't see the dot and extention's name. Don't be scary, this is because it's different Windows version.
So, we just need to motify a bit. 

* S1-02
We first click view at the top. 

*S1-03
We click **"Option"** tab.

*S1-04
We click **"View"** tab again. And we click off "Hide extensions for known file types"  There you go, bob is your uncle!

*S1-05
I use Sublime as my text editor. There're a lot of editor. Pick anyone you like.
